            <p><b>MAIN ACCORDS:Aquatic fresh and fruity</b></p>
            <p><i>Typically found in the shallow waters of Mexico's Gulf of California, the shy and elusive Vaquita 
                is the only species of porpoise that lives in warm waters. 
                As a nod to the warm, coastal waters the elusive creature calls home, Vaquita blends an
                aquatic sea salt accord with fresh waterlily. Vibrant redcurrant berries
                and juicy pear give the fragrance a spirited personality rounded out with a touch
                of cedarwood. The result? A fragrance as enigmatic and playful as its namesake.</i></p>
